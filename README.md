Applied Data Science Capstone

This Capstone is the 10th (final) course of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate specialization and actually summarizes in project form all the materials that were learned during this specialization.

ðŸ“„ Project history

SpaceX is the most successful company of the commercial space age, making space travel affordable. The company advertises on its website Falcon 9 rocket launches, costing 62 million dollars; other suppliers cost more than $165 million each, much of the savings are due to the fact that SpaceX can reuse the first stage. So if we can determine whether the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. Based on public information and machine learning models, we will predict whether SpaceX will reuse the first stage.

ðŸ“„ Questions to be answered How do variables such as payload mass, launch site, number of flights and orbits affect first stage landing success? Does the rate of successful landings increase over the years? What is the best algorithm that can be used for binary classification in this case?

ðŸ“„ Methodology

Data Collection Methodology Using the SpaceX Rest API
Using Web Scrapping from Wikipedia

Performing data wrangling Filtering the data Handling missing values Using One Hot Encoding to prepare the data for binary classification

Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualization and SQL

Performed interactive visual analysis using Folium and Plotly Dash

Predictive analysis performed using classification models Construction, tuning and evaluation of classification models to ensure the best resultsâ€‹
